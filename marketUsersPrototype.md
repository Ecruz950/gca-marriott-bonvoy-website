*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 
- **Airbnb** is a relevant comparison because it is a major platform for whole-home rentals and offers a wide range of features tailored to guest needs, including search filters, property details, and booking tools. I would say that is design and functionality set expectations for user experience in this industry.
- **Vrbo** is a relevant comparison because it focuses on vacation and short-term home rentals, making it a good reference for understanding how to present listings, highlight amenities, and guide users through the booking process.
- **Bookings** is another relevant comparison because it includes hotels, but also offers full apartments and houses. It’s a well-known site with a large audience, so it’s helpful to see how it presents different types of stays in one place and keeps things easy to navigate.

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that many Marriott Bonvoy members are still undecided about their destination when planning a vacation, with over 75% either unsure of the exact location or seeking inspiration. Based off the qualitative user reserach, users expressed frustration with the Homes and Villas website’s lack of helpful guidance when browsing without a set destination. Users struggled with vague location names, overwhelming map views, and insufficient descriptions or context for destinations. They wished for more intuitive filtering, clearer visuals, and pop-up summaries to help guide their decisions. Overall, users are seeking a more supportive and informative experience that inspires confidence when choosing where to go.
